            We are joining an organization called the <a
              href="http://seedeffect.org/" target=new>Seed Effect</a> this summer on an
            expedition to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=kajo+keji,+south+sudan&hl=en&ll=3.875216,31.673584&spn=11.326375,7.229004&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=71.101321,57.744141&t=h&hnear=Kajo+Keji,+Kajokeji,+Central+Equatoria,+South+Sudan&z=7" target=new>South Sudan</a>.  We will be working with their
            micro-finance organization to get a first-hand glimpse into the
            front lines of the fight against poverty.

            We believe that the most important part in this fight against
            poverty is knowing that God will never abandon or forsake you, that
            God is there for you and that even in the midst of poverty there is
            hope in Jesus.

                Microfinance enables people in the most poorest countries in the world to break the cycle of poverty -- so much so that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Yunus#Recognition" target=new>the originator was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006</a> for his work in this area.  It is a system that provides small (less than $500), collateral-free loans to income-generating businesses.  The borrowers are firmly rooted in a support community that helps them repay their loan with remarkably low default rates.  As loans are repaid, the money is re-invested into other loans.

            We are Aaron and Ashly Stacy.  We're a computer engineer and school
            teacher living in Austin, Texas, and we feel incredibly blessed.
            We also feel called by God to share the reason for the hope we
            have, and we're fortunate enough to have the chance to see God work
            in the lives of others in a culture different from our own.

              Jesus says that his followers <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2013:35&version=ESV">will be known by their love for each other,</a> and that's what initially drew me to Him.  Since then I have come to find my strength and purpose in Him, and I think there is nothing better I could do for a person than to share that love with them.  I am thankful and excited for the chance to go to South Sudan because I believe I'll have the chance to share what God has done in my life with others.

              One of the coolest things about being a Christ follower is being united with total strangers through the amazing love of Christ. I am excited to go and share my experience following Him with those who I might otherwise have very little in common. I am excited to learn, to grow, to be stretched, and to be HIS hands and HIS feet to those I come in contact with on this trip.
